If I were assigned to test an important functionality such as an authorization form, 
I would contact the development team or the product manager responsible for the development 
of the functionality to clarify any questions I might have. This would allow me to gain a 
better understanding of the expected behavior of the authorization form, and any specific requirements or constraints that I should be aware of during testing.

The main stages of working with the task would be as follows:

Understanding the requirements: The first stage would be to review the requirements for 
the authorization form, and to identify any specific features or functionality that need to be tested.

Test planning: Based on the requirements, I would create a test plan that outlines the testing approach, 
test cases, and test data needed to test the authorization form. The test plan would also identify the resources needed for testing and the timelines for testing.

Test execution: The next stage would be to execute the tests outlined in the test plan, using the 
test cases and test data identified in the planning stage. I would also be on the lookout for 
any unexpected behavior or issues during testing.

Defect reporting: If any issues are identified during testing, I would report them to the development 
team using a defect tracking system, along with any supporting information such as screenshots or error messages.

Retesting: After the development team has fixed any identified issues, I would retest the authorization 
form to ensure that the issues have been resolved and that the functionality is working as expected.

Documentation: Finally, I would document the testing process, including any issues that were identified 
and resolved, and any test cases or data that were used during testing. This documentation would be 
helpful for future testing efforts and for other members of the development team who may need to refer to the testing process.
